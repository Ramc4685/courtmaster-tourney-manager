# Tournament Manager Refactoring PRD (Revised)

## 1. Background

The Tournament Manager is a React/TypeScript application built with domain-driven design principles, managing tournaments, matches, teams, and player data. The application handles tournament creation, bracket generation, and match scoring.

### Current Technical Debt
1. **Bundle Size Issues:**
   - Main bundle (`index-DfCgw4lJ.js`) is 1.38MB minified (396.90KB gzipped)
   - Vendor chunk is 164.09KB minified (53.62KB gzipped)
   - Multiple chunks exceed recommended size limits

2. **Code Complexity:**
   - Large components (>300 lines): `UnifiedScheduleDialog.tsx` (411 lines), `ImportTeamsDialog.tsx` (332 lines)
   - Monolithic API service (`api.ts` - 649 lines)
   - Complex tournament management logic spread across multiple files

### Business Impact
1. **Performance:**
   - Large bundle sizes impact initial load time
   - Complex components cause rendering performance issues
   - Lack of code splitting affects page load times

2. **Development Velocity:**
   - Technical debt slows feature development
   - Complex components increase bug fix time
   - Lack of documentation increases onboarding time

## 2. Objectives

### Quantifiable Goals
1. **Bundle Size Reduction:**
   - Reduce main bundle size by 40% through code splitting
   - Keep individual chunks under 250KB
   - Implement dynamic imports for large components

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Reduce maximum component size to 200 lines
   - Achieve 80% test coverage (currently estimated <50%)
   - Reduce average cyclomatic complexity by 30%

3. **Developer Experience:**
   - Reduce new feature development time by 25%
   - Cut bug fix time by 40%
   - Decrease onboarding time by 50%

## 3. Proposed Changes

### A. Bundle Optimization
1. **Code Splitting:**
   ```javascript
   // Current:
   import { UnifiedScheduleDialog } from './UnifiedScheduleDialog';
   
   // Proposed:
   const UnifiedScheduleDialog = lazy(() => import('./UnifiedScheduleDialog'));
   ```

2. **Chunk Strategy:**
   - Implement route-based code splitting
   - Create feature-based chunks
   - Optimize vendor chunk splitting

### B. Component Refactoring

1. **UnifiedScheduleDialog.tsx** (411 lines):
   - Split into subcomponents:
     - `ScheduleHeader` (estimated 50 lines)
     - `MatchGrid` (estimated 100 lines)
     - `TimeSlotSelector` (estimated 80 lines)
     - `ValidationSection` (estimated 60 lines)

2. **ImportTeamsDialog.tsx** (332 lines):
   - Extract into:
     - `FileUploader` (estimated 70 lines)
     - `TeamDataValidator` (estimated 80 lines)
     - `ImportPreview` (estimated 100 lines)

### C. Service Layer Optimization

1. **API Service** (`api.ts` - 649 lines):
   - Split into domain-specific services:
     - `TournamentAPI` (estimated 200 lines)
     - `MatchAPI` (estimated 150 lines)
     - `TeamAPI` (estimated 150 lines)
     - `UserAPI` (estimated 100 lines)

2. **State Management:**
   - Implement centralized state management
   - Add state persistence layer
   - Implement optimistic updates

## 4. Impact Analysis

### Quantifiable Benefits

1. **Performance:**
   - Initial load time reduction: 40-50%
   - Time to interactive improvement: 30-40%
   - Memory usage reduction: 25-30%

2. **Development:**
   - Code review time reduction: 30%
   - Bug identification speed increase: 40%
   - Documentation coverage increase: 60%

### Long-term Benefits
1. **Maintainability Score Improvement:**
   - Current average: 65/100
   - Target: 85/100
   - Measured using SonarQube metrics

2. **Technical Debt Reduction:**
   - Current debt ratio: ~25%
   - Target ratio: <10%
   - Based on static analysis metrics

## 5. Risks & Mitigation

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Breaking Changes | High | Medium | Feature flags, A/B testing |
| Performance Regression | High | Low | Performance monitoring, automated tests |
| Data Loss | Critical | Very Low | Backup strategy, migration scripts |

### Rollout Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1-2)**
   - Set up monitoring
   - Implement feature flags
   - Create staging environment

2. **Phase 2: Core Refactoring (Week 3-4)**
   - Bundle optimization
   - Component splitting
   - Service layer restructuring

3. **Phase 3: Testing (Week 5)**
   - Performance testing
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing

## 6. Testing & Verification

### Test Coverage Goals
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Current coverage: ~40%
   - Target coverage: 80%
   - Focus areas: business logic, utilities

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Current coverage: ~30%
   - Target coverage: 70%
   - Priority: API integration, state management

3. **End-to-End Tests:**
   - Current coverage: ~20%
   - Target coverage: 50%
   - Critical flows: tournament creation, scoring

### Verification Process
1. **Automated Testing:**
   - Jest unit tests
   - React Testing Library integration tests
   - Cypress E2E tests

2. **Manual Testing:**
   - UX testing checklist
   - Cross-browser compatibility

   - Bundle size limits

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Error tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - User feedback collection

This revised PRD provides concrete metrics, phased implementation plans, and clear success criteria while maintaining the original scope of improvements. The addition of quantifiable goals and detailed rollout strategies will help track progress and ensure successful implementation.
