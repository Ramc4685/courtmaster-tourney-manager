# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
Resolving critical functionality issues, starting with authentication state persistence.

### Priority 1: Authentication State Loss (Issue #1)
Current implementation:
```typescript
// TournamentDetail.tsx
const handleRefresh = async () => {
  if (!id || !user) return;
  setIsRefreshing(true);
  try {
    await refreshTournament(id);
    // ... error handling
  }
};

// TournamentService.ts
async getTournament(id: string) {
  try {
    const tournament = await this.getTournaments();
    // ... save to storage
  }
}
```

Next implementation steps:
1. Add session persistence check in AuthContext
2. Implement user indicator in navigation
3. Add session recovery mechanism

### Upcoming Issues
1. Navigation Bar (Issue #2)
   - Needs audit and documentation of issues
   - Plan improvements based on findings

2. Tournament Deletion (Issue #3)
   - Review current implementation
   - Document specific issues
   - Plan improvements

3. Player Import/Registration (Issue #4)
   - Design new workflow
   - Plan database schema updates
   - Design email notification system

## Recent Changes
1. Authentication State Maintenance:
   - Added user state check in refresh handler
   - Implemented storage persistence
   - Updated tournament service

## Technical Considerations
1. Auth State Management:
   - Session persistence strategy
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Error recovery approach

2. Data Persistence:
   - Local storage strategy
   - Caching approach
   - Offline support planning

## Dependencies
1. Auth Context
2. Tournament Service

## Notes
- Need to maintain careful balance between local storage and server state
- Consider implementing proper state management system
- Plan for proper error handling and recovery
- Consider user experience during state transitions

# Active Context - Tournament Creation Issue

## Current Issue
- Tournament creation form submission is not working - "nothing happens when I create"
- Issue appears to be in the final submission step of the tournament wizard

## Root Cause Identified
The issue appears to be in the storage service configuration and initialization:

1. The `SupabaseStorageService` requires proper initialization and configuration
2. The storage service falls back to localStorage if Supabase is not configured
3. The `isSupabaseConfigured()` check may be failing, causing silent fallback
4. Tournament creation involves multiple steps:
   - Saving tournament data
   - Creating user-tournament relationship
   - Updating local state

## Investigation Progress
1. Checked form validation and types:
   - Form schema is properly defined in `src/components/admin/tournament/types.ts`
   - Uses Zod validation for tournament form data
   - Includes proper validation for all required fields

2. Examined Categories Step implementation:
   - Division and category management UI works
   - Form state updates correctly through wizard steps
   - No visible errors in the UI during form completion

3. Wizard Navigation:
   - Steps progress correctly (Basic Details → Categories → Scoring Rules → Registration)
   - All steps show as completed in progress indicator
   - Final "Create Tournament" button appears to be connected

4. Storage Implementation:
   - Uses a layered storage approach with multiple services
   - Supabase is the primary storage backend
   - Falls back to localStorage if Supabase is not configured
   - Includes real-time updates capability

## Solution Steps
1. Verify Supabase configuration:
   - Check if Supabase client is properly initialized
   - Ensure environment variables are set
   - Validate authentication state

2. Add error logging:
   - Add detailed error logging in storage service
   - Track storage service fallbacks
   - Monitor Supabase connection state

3. Fix storage service initialization:
   - Properly configure storage service at app startup
   - Handle authentication state
   - Manage user session

4. Improve error handling:
   - Add user feedback for storage errors
   - Handle offline scenarios
   - Provide clear error messages

## Next Steps
1. Add logging to tournament creation flow
2. Check network requests during submission
3. Verify service layer implementation
4. Test error handling paths

## Recent Changes
- Updated division and category management
- Improved wizard navigation
- Enhanced form validation
- Modified tournament types and schemas

## Known Working Parts
- Form validation
- Wizard navigation
- Division/category management UI
- Data collection through steps

## Current Focus
Debugging the tournament creation submission process, specifically focusing on the storage service configuration and initialization.
