# State Management Migration Guide

This document outlines the migration path from React Context API to Zustand for state management.

## Overview

The application is being migrated from the Context API to Zustand for improved:
- Performance
- Developer experience
- Code organization
- Maintainability
- Type safety
- State persistence

## Migration Strategy

The migration follows these steps:

1. **Parallel Systems**: Both Context API and Zustand implementations exist side-by-side
2. **Feature-by-Feature Migration**: Each feature is migrated incrementally
3. **Adapter Pattern**: Compatibility layers ensure components work with either implementation
4. **Gradual Adoption**: Components are updated one at a time to use the new API directly

## Switching Between Implementations

To toggle between Context API and Zustand:

```bash
# Use Context API (default)
npm run dev

# Use Zustand
npm run dev:zustand
```

## Migration Status

| Team Management        | ✅ Complete | With import/export functionality |
| Match Operations       | ✅ Complete | Basic operations implemented |
| Court Management       | ✅ Complete | Including auto-assignment |
| Scoring System        | ✅ Complete | With standalone and tournament modes |
| Profile Management    | ✅ Complete | With persistence layer |
| Notification System   | ✅ Complete | Real-time notifications |
| Tournament Progression | 🔄 In Progress | Stage management being implemented |
| Category Management   | 🔄 In Progress | Basic structure in place |

## Migration Checklist

When migrating a component:

1. Create Zustand store with proper typing
2. Implement store actions and state management
3. Create adapter if needed for backward compatibility
4. Update components to use new store
5. Add persistence layer if required
6. Test both implementations
7. Remove Context dependencies
8. Clean up unused code

## Current Focus Areas

1. Complete Tournament Progression implementation
2. Finish Category Management system
3. Implement Bracket Generation algorithms
4. Begin Statistics & Reports development

## Final Steps

Once all features are migrated:
1. Remove Context implementation
2. Remove adapters
3. Set `USE_ZUSTAND=true` as default
4. Clean up unused files
5. Update documentation

## Performance Monitoring

- Monitor bundle size impact
- Track re-render frequency
- Measure state update performance
- Profile memory usage

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for store logic
2. Integration tests for store interactions
3. Migration path testing
4. Backward compatibility verification
